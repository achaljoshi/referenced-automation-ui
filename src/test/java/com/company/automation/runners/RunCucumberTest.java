/**
 * Full regression entry point: {@code mvn test} (via the Surefire include
 * pattern {@code **}{@code /Run*.java}) discovers this class and runs every
 * {@code .feature} file under {@code src/test/resources/features}.
 *
 * <p>Glue path, plugin list (Extent/Allure/StepLogger/rerun-file/etc.) and
 * parallel execution are configured once in {@code junit-platform.properties}
 * so they stay identical locally and in CI, and so every runner in this
 * package shares the exact same reporting setup. Only run-specific things
 * (e.g. a tag filter, see {@link RunSmokeTest}) are overridden per runner.
 *
 * <p>Consuming projects should copy this pattern in their own repo, pointing
 * {@code cucumber.glue} at their own step-definitions package in addition to
 * {@code com.company.automation.hooks}.
